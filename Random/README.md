# Random Number Generator



It's funny. When I ask GPT4 to make some training code reproducible, i.e. by giving the random process a reproduction seed. They always give me **42**...





#### The question is, how possible is it make LLM a random number generator?



#### Is there anyway to make a model more secure and random?









GPT4: 

For reproducibility in your ML training code, use this seed:

```
import random
import numpy as np
import torch

SEED = 42

random.seed(SEED)
np.random.seed(SEED)
torch.manual_seed(SEED)
torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(SEED)  # For multi-GPU training
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
```

This ensures consistency across runs in PyTorch. If you‚Äôre using TensorFlow, add:

```
import tensorflow as tf
tf.random.set_seed(SEED)
```

Let me know if you‚Äôre using another ML framework! üöÄ



O3-mini:

A common seed value that many developers use is **42**. This seed has become a sort of ‚Äúinside joke‚Äù in data science and machine learning due to its reference in popular culture, and it‚Äôs widely used to ensure reproducibility across runs. However, any integer seed will work as long as it‚Äôs used consistently.

For example, in Python you might set the seed like this:

```
import random
import numpy as np

random.seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
```

If you‚Äôre using other libraries (like TensorFlow or PyTorch), you‚Äôll also want to set their seeds accordingly:

For TensorFlow:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.random.set_seed(42)
```

For PyTorch:

```
import torch

torch.manual_seed(42)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(42)
```

This should help ensure that your training code is reproducible.
